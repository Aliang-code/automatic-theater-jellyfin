in the wake
of the so-called "Eye in the Sky Event."

[reporter 2] Millions have taken
to the streets

00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,391
after the revelation that an alien race

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,685
known as the San-Ti
are headed towards Earth.

00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,895
[reporter 3] Many nations

Humanity will survive this present crisis,

as we have survived all the crises before.

[reporter 4] The Home Office
has neither confirmed nor denied

the formation of a multinational agency

In his widely televised speech today,

Nothing gets done without money.

[reporter 10] Not everyone seems
to fear the arrival of the San-Ti.

Some are welcoming…

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,862
[reporter 11] Religious sects have emerged
devoted to the worship of the San-Ti.

39
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,449
To them, the aliens are saviors,
not aggressors.

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,161
Law enforcement have not determined
whether these groups are dangerous.

They are monitoring…

[reporter 12] The revelation
has been met with despair by many.

The NHS has declared
a mental health emergency.

And with 400 years looming

Everyone's terrified.

People are killing themselves.

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,268
A lot of your followers.

65
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,647
You led them straight to hell.

00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,988
Why did Vera have to die?

67
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,285
She taught me
how to think like a scientist.

68
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
She gave me a purpose.

69
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,250
Your daughter, why did she have to die?

70
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,964
Did you order Jack's murder?

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,220
He was smart and loyal and funny,
and you had him slaughtered.

72
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,222
For what?

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,644
Don't just sit there, staring at me.
Tell me why!

74
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,372
On the stage where my father was killed,
there was a poster.

75
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,376
I saw it all over Beijing that year.

76
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,048
A man with a hammer
smashing the Buddha, Jesus,

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,800
and a rock and roll record.

78
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,681
The slogan said, "Destroy the old world."

79
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,850
"Forge the new world."

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,063
It's the only thing
I ever agreed with the Red Guards about.

81
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,358
[Jin] "Forge a new world."

82
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,069
Is that what you think you're doing?

83
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,906
You betrayed everyone alive,

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,201
everyone who's going to be born, for what?

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,497
So that aliens who think we're bugs
can come here and kill us all?

86
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,666
So that they could save us.

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,587
Didn't you see the Eye in the Sky?

88
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,007
Do you really think
they're still trying to save us?

89
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,846
[quietly] No.

00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,015
[takes a deep breath]

91
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,100
They learned the truth about us.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,228
We lie. We deceive.

93
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,359
There's a darkness in us
that they cannot understand.

94
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,530
We're too dangerous to coexist with.

95
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,867
And it never occurred to you
that you were risking everything,

96
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,704

to conquer our world?

[somber music playing]

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,541
I was willing to risk everything.

99
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,627
I saw the path we were on.

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,588
-I saw where it led--
-"I," "I," I," "I."

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,383
Who gave you the right
to decide for all of us?

102
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,350
You know, Vera always said
you were a great physicist,

103
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,477
but that's not how you'll be remembered.

104
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,896
You're a traitor.

106
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,111

As someone who fought back.

[birds singing]

111
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,522
[Wade] From now on, the real work
of defending humanity will happen here,

112
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,734
far from urban rioting,
alien worshippers, and suicide cults,

113
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,029
where we can plan
the defeat of the San-Ti in peace.

114
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,116
So, make yourselves comfortable,

115
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,910
Nobel laureates and jealous fucks
who think they should be.

116
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,704
You're gonna be here for a while.

117
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,292
Despite what a depressingly large number
of Neanderthals seem to believe,

118
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,502
the San-Ti are real.

119
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,754
And they have declared war on us.

120
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,214
I plan on fighting back.

121
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,260
If their Sophons can see and hear
everything, won't they know our plans?

122
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,178
Let them listen.

123
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,222
-Mr. Wade, the things they can do--
-[Wade] There are things they can't do.

124
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,809
They can't lie.
We know that from the Evans transcripts.

125
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,396
And they've only got two Sophons.
They told us so themselves.

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,397
[woman] "Only"?

127
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,817
Only two omniscient supercomputers,
the size of protons?

128
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,903
[Wade] That took them
millions of years to build.

129
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,739
Their technology moves slow.
Ours moves fast.

130
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,908
That's why they're
going after our research.

131
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,242
Fine. Let them do their worst.

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,203
But our advanced research
has been sabotaged.

133
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,412
How do we catch up?

134
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,916
We keep developing the technology
we have, and in the meantime,

135
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,543
we need to learn more
about the way they do things.

136
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's learn from the source.

137
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
[man] So you want to spy on them?

138
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,592
-You want to build a telescope.
-[Wade] NASA can play with telescopes.

139
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,053
We're gonna launch a probe
to intercept the enemy fleet.

00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,679
[tense music playing]

141
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,307
They sent Sophons to Earth
to learn about us.

142
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,142
We need to do the same to them.

143
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,811
Are their ships
the size of cities or thimbles?

144
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,396
What are their weaknesses?

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,732
We need to know the enemy
to fight the enemy.

146
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,860
Sir, even if
we launched a probe tomorrow--

147
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,029
We would meet them in about…

148
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,824
398 years.

149
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,162
They're travelling at 1% light speed.
That should be our goal as well.

150
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,247
[woman sighs]

151
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,710
[sighs] Perhaps in 100 years,
1% light speed might be achievable.

152
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,547
But if you want to launch
a reconnaissance probe immediately,

153
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,798
it's simply impossible.

154
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,592
It's not impossible.
They did it. Why can't we?

155
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
We are not them.

156
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,764
No, you're not.

157
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,394
[Wade] I hear you plan on fighting back.
So do I.

158
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,148
Now, there's only two Sophons.
They can be anywhere but not everywhere.

159
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,611
I've ordered every particle accelerator
on the planet to start up again, 24-7.

160
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,031
Now, how busy do you reckon
that'll keep Ma and Pa Sophon?

161
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,157
[Jin] Not very.

162
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,494
One Sophon can circumnavigate
the planet in an eighth of a second.

163
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,496
There's 2,000 accelerators.

164
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,541
All right. Say you align the schedules
and have experiments

165
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,002
on opposite sides of the globe
happen at regular intervals.

166
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,337
That might keep
one Sophon going indefinitely.

167
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,548
Better yet, build one on the moon.

168
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,507
The moon?

169
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,843
Why not?
That's three seconds there and back.

170
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,387
That still leaves the other one
to paint countdowns

171
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,097
on people's eyes and drive them mad.

172
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,475
Focusing on a single target would keep
the other Sophon going constantly.

173
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,102
That's a huge cost for the San-Ti.

174
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,188
There you go.
You're working for me already.

175
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,149
[takes a deep breath]

176
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm launching a reconnaissance probe
to intercept the San-Ti.

177
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,113
The engineers I have
are the most accomplished in the world,

178
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,115
but they're all fixated on feasibility.

179
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,326
"Everything is limited.
Nothing is possible."

180
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,661
Here's my challenge to you.

181
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,706
Find me a way to get a probe
to 1% light speed or faster,

182
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,333
utilizing existing technology.

183
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,253
If you can dream up a solution,
I want you to come to Wychwood Manor

184
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,546
and present your proposal.

185
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,173
[sighs]

186
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
[gulls calling]

187
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,433
-[Saul] Want some?
-[Will] No, I'm good.

188
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,227
You sure? It'll help with the pain.

189
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,063
It's not so bad right now.

190
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,025
You don't have to do
the stiff-upper-lip thing, English.

191
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,443
[chuckles] I'm telling you,

192
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,613
when it's my turn on the rack,
I'm gonna be cryin' like a baby.

193
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,992
You know what? Every now and then,
my body actually feels pretty good.

194
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,413
Then I can just concentrate
on the sheer fucking terror of it all.

195
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,043
[bottle opens]

196
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,675
[Will] Not that I've started
believing in God, exactly, but

197
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,929
I've sort of taken to picturing myself
up there when it's all over.

198
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,810
Fuck it.
Here's what I need you to do, all right?

199
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
After I'm gone,
buy yourself a wood chipper.

200
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,897
-Uh-huh.
-Pop me in.

201
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,067
Turn me into a fine mist,
rising into the ozone.

202
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,111
I don't think a chipper
would aerosolize your body.

203
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,238
Don't be a smart-ass. All right?

204
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,700
This is my last will and testament.
Have some goddamn respect.

205
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,910
-So it shall be.
-[chuckles]

206
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,120
[Auggie] Hey, guys.

207
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
[Saul] Hey.

208
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,500
Hi.

209
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,460
[Auggie sighs]

210
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,760
-[wind whistling]
-[gulls crying above]

211
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,806
Are you okay?

212
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,979
Yeah.

213
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,065
[somber music playing]

214
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,403
The English really suck at beaches.

215
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,280
[exhales]

216
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,955
[tense, energetic music playing]

217
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,040
[low, indistinct chatter]

218
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,313
[Jin] During the Ming Dynasty,
the Chinese Navy built a gunpowder rocket

219
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,690
with smaller missiles stored inside.

220
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,402
The result was a medieval weapon
that caused 20th-century damage.

221
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,947
So there is already a precedent
for achieving advanced results

222
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,783
using current materials.

223
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,040
Now, the energy required to propel
a probe of even a few kilograms

224
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,125
to 1% light speed is massive.

225
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,504
However, we do have
a source of that energy.

226
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,800
I mean to use our nuclear weapons.

227
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,470
[woman scoffs] A spaceship
filled with atomic bombs?

228
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,264
Perhaps you've been watching
too many Vin Diesel films.

229
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:31,268
The mass of a ship like that would make
it almost impossible to launch, anyway.

230
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,645
[Jin] That's very true.

231
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,482
But as you can see on page five,
the bombs won't be on the probe.

232
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,776
The probe itself
would have very little mass,

233
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,820
making it far easier to accelerate.

234
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,907
And how exactly is it going to work?

235
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,575
That's on page 12.

236
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,581
I'm borrowing an old idea
from Stanislav Ullam in the 1940s,

237
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,667
called "Nuclear Pulse Propulsion."

238
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,801
[tense music playing]

239
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,888
Imagine a series of 1,000 nuclear devices
evenly spaced in distance,

240
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,267
stretching from Earth
toward the San-Ti fleet.

241
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,396
Now, these bombs could be
put in place using existing spacecraft.

242
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,858
The probe would have
a mass of under 1,000 kilograms

243
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,319
and be propelled by a radiation sail.

244
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,700
As the probe passes the first bomb,
it detonates,

245
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,743
accelerating it towards the second,

246
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,498
which detonates, accelerating it
again and again and again.

247
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,002
If we can precisely time the detonations
as the probe passes,

248
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,755
and impart 30 kilonewtons
of force on the probe per explosion,

249
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,466
the compounding rate of acceleration
will mean we can reach

250
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,095
1.12% light speed after 1,000 explosions.

251
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,976
Like steps on a staircase, each bomb
brings us closer to our destination.

252
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,818
It's a very creative notion,
but it's totally untested,

253
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,153
with zero margin for error--

254
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,197
And it would surely violate
more than a few nuclear treaties--

255
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
Not to mention the cost. Trillions?

256
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,077
Valid points. Dr. Cheng?

257
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,539
Treaties can be amended.

258
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,626
Our job is to come up with
a solution to a scientific problem.

259
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,711
It's someone else's job
to come up with the money,

260
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,923
and there's no version of this
that doesn't require a lot of money.

261
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,009
I agree, the margin for error is small.

262
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,303
But it's not impossible.

263
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,932
I compliment you, Dr. Cheng,
for this entertaining proposal.

264
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,560
But the only way
to truly achieve 1% light speed

265
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,312
is with decades of research,

266
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,439
not pyrotechnic stunts.

267
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,275
We've got 400 years, Mr. Wade.

268
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,444
What's a few decades?

269
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,990
I think it's worth pursuing.

270
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,577
The closer we get to them,
the more we'll know about them.

271
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,206
It's the first proposal I've heard
to get us to 1% in our lifetimes,

272
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,502
and I have no intention of dying with
my agency having accomplished fuck all.

273
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,170
[man 1 inhales sharply]

274
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,630
[man 2 clears throat]

275
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,349
Let's find you an office.

276
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,434
[music fades slowly]

277
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,729
[group members chatting indistinctly]

278
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,775
[dog barking in distance]

279
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,818
[reporter] Scientists…

280
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,195
[Saul] Aliens won't be here for 400 years.

281
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,614
It's a long time
to hoard digestive biscuits.

282
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,534
[Auggie] We've lost the plot.

283
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,869
[reporter] Meanwhile,
an ambitious, new initiative,

284
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,705
"The Stars Our Destination,"

285
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,834
is attracting the attention
of the world's wealthiest individuals.

286
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,212
For donations in the reported
eight- to nine-figure range,

287
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,757
the richest men and women
have acquired ownership rights

288
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,635
over stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

289
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,013
-Rights which most…
-I don't get it.

290
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,182
It's a fundraiser for the war effort.

291
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,144
Bake sale for billionaires.

292
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,062
People make donations,
and we're gonna catch up

293
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
to the little green men
who put a giant Eye in the Sky?

294
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,316
At least they're doing something.

295
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,319
Some people are worshipping the aliens.
That's something.

296
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,947
We should use that money
to help people now.

297
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,409
Not fund a war
that's not gonna happen till 2400.

298
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,995
[Will] It's a good story,
though, isn't it?

299
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,998
It's much more exciting
to imagine a future War of the Worlds

300
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,709
than it is to muck around
with our current problems.

301
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,921
[sighs] I just want a beer. Any beer.

302
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,258
The pub might get some in tonight,
if you're willing to fight the crowd.

303
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,510
Is there any chance I could preorder

304
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,847
five bottles of your next shipment
of really good whiskey?

305
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,307
[clerk] What'd you have in mind?

306
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,269
Um… Macallan 30?

307
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,687
Pricey stuff.

308
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,191
-I've come into a bit of money.
-[typing]

309
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,985
[reporter] …to join
the Strategic Intelligence Agency.

310
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,654
That's unavailable till the new year.
Can you wait?

311
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,241
I will be unavailable then, as well.

312
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,287
[knocking on door]

313
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,914
Come in.

314
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,761
You wanted to speak to me?

315
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,554
You have three minutes.

316
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,848
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,142
Thank you for seeing me.

318
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,561
-I thought--
-Open the window, would you?

319
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,729
It's stuffy in here.

320
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,367

[Raj sighs]

324
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,133
I have to say, sir, I know this one.

325
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,927
The window. It's sealed shut,

326
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,014
and you asked me to open it to see
how I respond to an impossible task.

327
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,351
Do I give up? Do I use some kind of tool?

328
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,811
Do I break the window?

329
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,899
[crow cawing outside]

330
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,192
[Wade sighs]

331
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,779
[exhales] Two minutes.

332
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,781
Yes, sir.

333
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,956
I thought I comported myself well
in Panama.

334
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,208
Oh. You're looking for commendations?

335
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,127
Maybe you should go back to the Navy.

336
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,254
Sail around in circles
wearing a funny hat.

337
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,132
I don't want to go back to the Navy.
I want to work for you.

338
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,051
I want you to realize someone
with a background in nuclear engineering

339
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,971
and naval strategy
should be on your space fleet team,

340
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,266
and not doing office admin
or trying to open your goddamn windows.

341
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,186
What space fleet team?

342
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,606
The one designing our first ships.
You've had it going for a month.

343
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,108
-You don't have clearance to know that.
-I know.

344
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,569
-How long have you known about it?
-Two weeks.

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,988
Then you're two weeks late coming to me.

346
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,907
I didn't want to overstep.

347
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,242
If you're afraid of overstepping,
you shouldn't be here.

348
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,869
Put me on the space fleet team.

349
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,245
Done.

350
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,457
Thank you.

351
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,250
Sir.

352
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,211
You'll love it on Mare Imbrium.

353
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,796
[tense music playing]

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,089
Mare Imbrium?

355
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,176
On the moon?

356
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,220
We're building a base there.

357
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,557
That's where we're going to assemble
the ships. Lower gravity, larger ships.

358
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,268
Dangerous work,
but it'll get you your commendations,

359
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,645
if you survive.

360
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,814
Close the window on your way out.

361
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,859
[exhales resolutely]

362
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,945
[gulls crying]

363
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,908
Hi.

364
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,120
[rock music playing on stereo]

365
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,664
[Auggie] Oh, thank God.

366
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
How is he?

367
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,716
I'm glad you're done ghosting me.

368
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,261
Still haven't said where you were.

369
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,388
Raj didn't tell you?

370
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,639
Raj?

371
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,268
-You were with him?
-Oi. You made it. [chuckles]

372
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
Hey.

373
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,439
Hey, and you brought your own food.

374
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,774
[chuckles]

375
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:20,279
It's for you. Little housewarming for
when you're too lazy to look at the ocean.

376
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,949
I love the little fella already.

377
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,575
[chuckles]

378
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,914
Who was it that wrote the, um, uh…
The Fisherman and the Golden Fish?

379
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,458
It was Pushkin, I think.

380
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,043
Pushkin, that's it.

381
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,296
That's what I'll name you.

382
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,131
Pushkin.

383
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,383
That suits you.

384
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,433
[Jin] Thanks for dinner, guys.

385
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,809
[Saul] Uh-huh.

386
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,525
[Jin] Hey, slow down.

387
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,279
I can't believe you're working
for that fascist fuck again.

388
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,905
I know how he comes across.

389
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,494
But he's a fighter,
and after everything I've been through,

390
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,497
everything we've been through,
how can I not help fight this?

391
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,416
You sound like you admire him.

392
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,127
I think he's trying,
which is more than most people can say.

393
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,503
He's a murderer.

394
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,675
The San-Ti declared war on us.

395
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,219
-That's what the Eye in the Sky was!
-[plates clatter]

396
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,224
Has Raj told you anything about Panama?

397
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,605
Jesus Christ,
do you know your boyfriend at all?

398
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,568
-Okay, you're scaring me.
-[Auggie] You should ask him.

399
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,571
Let's see if he tells you the truth.

400
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,159
I will, but the San-Ti are real,
and I have to do something--

401
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,328
[Auggie] They're 400 years away.

402
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,915
Everyone you know and love
will be dead before they even get here.

403
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,875
And their kids, their grandkids, and--

404
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,836
-You're gonna pretend nothing's happening?
-I'm not pretending anything.

405
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,338
[tense music playing]

406
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,977
What are you even working on
for that piece of shit?

407
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,482
I need a radiation sail,

408
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,694
about five square kilometers in area,
but with a mass of less than 50 kilograms.

409
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,280
No.

410
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,283
Everything depends on this nanosail,

411
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,327
and there's no one
who can design it besides you.

412
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,662
I said no.

413
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,789
We've got some of the best physicists
working on this.

414
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,957
The resources are insane!

415
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,918
The last time we gave the best physicists
in the world insane resources,

416
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,420
they gave us Hiroshima.

417
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,505
No, I'm not designing a weapon.

418
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,589
Not yet.

419
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
-[gulls crying]
-[tense music fades]

420
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,931
[Jin] Hey.

421
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,308
You're up early.

422
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,978
[Will] Oh, I'm always here at sunrise.

423
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,316
[rocks clatter]

424
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,652
[rock splashes]

425
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,412
You know, you could have told me.

426
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,208
I didn't wanna worry you.

427
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,961
What could you have done?

428
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,340
I'd have been fucking furious
if you'd just… If you…

429
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,387
If you'd gone and just…

430
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,224
[crying] …not told me.

431
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,518
[soft, tender music playing]

432
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,519
[rocks clatter]

433
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,104
[rock splashes]

434
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,526
[softly] Hey.

435
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,906
You want me to stay a few more days?

436
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,826
No, I won't stand for it.

437
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:02,125
You go and save the world,
and I will be just fine right here.

438
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,293
[rock splashes]

439
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,901
[Jin chuckles softly]

440
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,749
[exhales]

441
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,129
Imagine this one's you, and this one's me.

442
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,345
[tender piano music building]

443
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,460
[tender music fades slowly]

444
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,546
[birds singing outside]

445
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,507
[Saul] 'Sup, bro?

446
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,467
What's up?

447
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,138
Jin still here?

448
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,224
No, she left about 20 minutes ago.

449
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,518
How'd you leave things?

450
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,854
[inhales sharply] Same as always.

451
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,148
"Nice to see you. See you soon."

452
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,942
"Thanks for coming. Come back anytime."

453
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,529
Nothing else?

454
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,032
[takes a deep breath] Like what?

455
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,825
Christ almighty, man!

456
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,871
You'd think that dying of all things
would make you open up for a change.

457
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,707
It was a nice, no-drama goodbye.

458
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,916
Why ruin it?

459
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,544
I've never seen anyone
love someone like you love her,

460
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,630
and you're just gonna
take that to the grave?

461
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,548
Wood chipper, don't forget.

462
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,260
If I was in your shoes,
I'd let the whole universe know.

463
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,430
Do you know how many times
I've played this out in my mind?

464
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,598
Millions.

465
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,309
And every time, it ends up
awkward and unfair to Jin.

466
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,437
Because she obviously
doesn't feel the same way.

467
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,731
-Maybe she does. How do you know?
-[Will] All right. Fine.

468
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,524
Let's say I did it, all right?

469
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:36,071
I go there, I get down on my knees,
and I compose her a fucking sonnet.

470
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,241
Then what? What's she gonna do?
She gonna leave her boyfriend?

471
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,701
Fuck him!

472
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,786
[Will scoffs]

473
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,997
No, I'm… I have half a mind
to put you on a train to London

474
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,584
so you can say your piece…
and get it off your chest.

475
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,169
[Auggie] What is Will gonna do?

476
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,338
Will is not doing anything.

477
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,091
He is the one who wants
to send a dying man to London

478
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,886
to pour his heart out to a girl and ruin
their perfectly lovely friendship.

479
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,973
Yes. You should absolutely do that.

480
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,060
She has a boyfriend!

481
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,770
Fuck him.

482
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,193
[somber music playing]

483
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
[indistinct chatter]

484
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,866
[heavy breathing]

485
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,952
[train rattling on tracks]

486
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,543
[sighs]

487
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,424
[exhales heavily]

488
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,813
[sighs]

489
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,861
[exhales sharply]

490
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,991
[Raj] It was a classified operation.

491
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,617
There's rules I have to follow.

492
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,036
I've had the same clearance
as you for a week now.

493
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,038
Yeah, we've barely seen one another.

494
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,542
When do you suppose I should've
sat you down to tell you everything?

495
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,210
The night you got back from Panama,

496
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,337
you said it was
an ordinary training exercise.

497
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,464
I had to.

498
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,633
How could you not be bothered
when 1,000 people were killed?

499
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,803
The people on that ship
murdered scientists.

500
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:28,600
They crippled our research so the San-Ti
can murder the rest of us more easily.

501
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,353
These are the people who murdered Jack.

502
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,899
If you had the chance,
what would you have done?

503
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,444
What bothers me is that you seem
so comfortable with the result.

504
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,323
You do realize that the work you're doing
for Wade is in preparation for war.

505
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,200
If you're not comfortable
being part of a war,

506
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,827
it doesn't make sense for you
to lead a reconnaissance mission.

507
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,162
Don't drag me into the mud.

508
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,456
What I'm doing
and what you did don't even compare.

509
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,209
Some of us have to do the ugly stuff
so you can keep your hands clean.

510
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,418
Ugh.

511
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,045
