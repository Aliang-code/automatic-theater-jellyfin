1
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,600
My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful

2
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,235
when the sun is low.

3
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,141
Rolling over the sands...

4
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,144
you can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:24,460
At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,097
The outsiders
race against time

7
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,500
to avoid the heat of the day.

8
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:43,279
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

9
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:47,283
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

10
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:54,390
These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,

11
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,492
came long before I was born.

12
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:58,494
By controlling
spice production,

13
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,396
they became obscenely rich.

14
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,199
Richer than
the Emperor himself.

15
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,385
-

16
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:48,377
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

17
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,679
but one day,

18
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:53,082
by Imperial decree,
they were gone.

19
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,358
Why did the Emperor
choose this path?

20
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,128
And who will
our next oppressors be?

21
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:59,148
It's good you're up early.

22
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,851
Your father wants you
in full dress

23
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,653
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

24
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,821
Full dress?

25
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,424
Military?

26
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:11,027
-Ceremonial.
-

27
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,361
Why do we have to go
through all this

28
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,963
when it's already
been decided?

29
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,432
Ceremony.

30
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,134
Mm.

31
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,036
Thank you.

32
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:23,873
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

33
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:26,175
Use the Voice.

34
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,110
Mom, I just woke up.

35
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,354
Give me the water.

36
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:40,723
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

37
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,186
Give me the water.

38
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:23,666
Almost.

39
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,101
Almost?

40
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,603
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

41
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,573
Mm-hmm.
-You look tired.

42
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,775
More dreams?

43
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,448
No.

44
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,053
Extreme temperatures

45
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,788
and treacherous weather events

46
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,625
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

47
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,594
with sandstorms
powerful enough

48
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,295
to cut through metal.

49
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,098
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

50
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,769
have adapted
well enough to survive.

51
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:04,306
Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,

52
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,308
the Fremen share
the deep desert

53
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,977
with the giant sandworms

54
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,480
known to the Fremen
as  Shai-Hulud.

55
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,150
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

56
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,919
their characteristic
blue eyes,

57
00:06:16,986 --> 00:06:18,954
the Eyes of Ibad.

58
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:22,057
Little else is known
of the Fremen,

59
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:26,162
except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.

60
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:28,964
Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting

61
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:30,933
extremely hazardous.

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,670
For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen

63
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,105
which preserves life

64
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,974
and brings
enormous health benefits.

65
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,676
For the Imperium,

66
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,912
spice is used
by the navigators

67
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,680
of the Spacing Guild

68
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,650
to find safe paths
between the stars.

69
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,951
Without spice,

70
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,021
interstellar travel
is impossible,

71
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,589
making it by far

72
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:56,859
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

73
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:47,343
Smile, Gurney.

74
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,513
I am smiling.

75
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,082
How much will it cost them,

76
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,684
traveling all this way
for this formality?

77
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,086
Three Guild Navigators.

78
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,856
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

79
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:19,842
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

80
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,877
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

81
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:24,780
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,118
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

83
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,121
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

84
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,723
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

85
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,093
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

86
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,864
The Emperor has spoken.

87
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,101
"House Atreides
shall immediately

88
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:47,937
take control of Arrakis

89
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,206
and serve as its steward."

90
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,810
Do you accept?

91
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,889
We are House Atreides.

92
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:08,891
There is no call
we do not answer,

93
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,293
there is no faith
that we betray.

94
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:16,398
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

95
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,901
House Atreides accepts.

96
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:23,339
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

97
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,910
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

98
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,518
Your seal.

99
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,555
So, it's done?

100
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,659
It's done.

101
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:44,720
How was it?

102
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,221
Stabilizers are too loose.

103
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,390
-We'll dial it in.
-Thank you, my friend.

104
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,558
Got it.

105
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,260
Duncan.

106
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,428
My boy.

107
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,929
-Hey. Hey.

108
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,564
Paul, my boy.

109
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,735
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

110
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:01,270
With the advance team.

111
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,838
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

112
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,173
with the advance team.

113
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,109
I'd like you
to take me with you.

114
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:08,744
You would?

115
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,680
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

116
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,183
Duncan.

117
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,518
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

118
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,687
What's going on?

119
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,189
Can I trust you
with something?

120
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:21,523
Always. You know that.

121
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,898
I've been having dreams.

122
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,970
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

123
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,980
Okay.

124
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,281
So?

125
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,917
I saw you.

126
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,323
With the Fremen.

127
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,158
Ah.

128
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,659
So, I do find them.

129
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,095
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

130
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:03,665
Lanville!

131
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,974
I saw you lying dead.

132
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,676
Fallen in battle.

133
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,313
It felt like
if I had been there,

134
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,182
you'd be alive.

135
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,655
First off, I'm not gonna die.

136
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:27,923
You're not
taking me seriously.

137
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,025
That's why
you want to come with me.

138
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,460
Listen.

139
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:33,195
Dreams make good stories,

140
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,697
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

141
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,866
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

142
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,302
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

143
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,603
I did?

144
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,938
No.

145
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,109
Hey.

146
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:49,344
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

147
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,748
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

148
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,585
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

149
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,587
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

150
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,921
Out of the question.

151
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,323
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

152
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,524
like the rest of us.

153
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,892
I've been training
my whole life.

154
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,227
What is the point

155
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,595
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

156
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,929
You know why, Paul.

157
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,098
You're the future
of House Atreides.

158
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,601
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

159
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,402
Yes.

160
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,104
And look where that got him.

161
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,777
I need you by my side.

162
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,914
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

163
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,549
What danger?

164
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,517
The Fremen? The desert?

165
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,553
Political danger.

166
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,691
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

167
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,793
and this threatens
the Emperor.

168
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:15,130
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

169
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,299
he sets the stage for a war

170
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,534
which would weaken
both houses.

171
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,804
But if we hold firm,

172
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,973
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

173
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,376
we could be stronger
than ever.

174
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:29,077
What does that mean?

175
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:30,279
Mining spice,

176
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,880
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

177
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,148
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

178
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,650
No.

179
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,886
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

180
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:40,656
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

181
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,258
Here on Caladan,

182
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,827
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

183
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,765
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

184
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:54,803
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

185
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,271
Learn what I do.

186
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,106
What if I'm not, Dad?

187
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,143
Not what?

188
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,180
The future of House Atreides.

189
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,995
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

190
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,801
I wanted to be a pilot.

191
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,437
You never told me that.

192
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,542
Your grandfather said,

193
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,378
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

194
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,115
He's called to it,
and he answers."

195
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,685
And if your answer is no...

196
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:49,992
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

197
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,061
my son.

198
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:07,175
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

199
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,514
In their memory...

200
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,852
give it a try.

201
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,863
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

202
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,599
How many times
do we have to tell you?

203
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,100
I could tell it was you

204
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,935
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

205
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,772
Someone
might imitate my stride.

206
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,106
I know the difference.

207
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,775
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

208
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,612
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

209
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,114
Choose your blade.

210
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,949
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

211
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,085
Give us a song instead.

212
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,757
That's rude.

213
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,810
Come on.

214
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,911
Come on.

215
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,212
Old man.

216
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,426
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

217
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,335
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

218
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,636
-Mood?
-Yeah.

219
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:42,838
What's mood to do with it?

220
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,673
You fight
when the necessity arises,

221
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,774
no matter the mood.

222
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:46,942
Now fight!

223
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,448
Come on!

224
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,496
-I have you.

225
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:09,297
Aye.

226
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:11,032
But look down, my lord.

227
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,702
You'd have joined me in death.

228
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,670
I see you found the mood.

229
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:29,484
Will it be that bad?

230
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:32,053
You don't get it, do you?

231
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,388
You don't really understand

232
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,158
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

233
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,061
For 80 years,

234
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,297
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

235
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,866
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

236
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,068
Can you imagine the wealth?

237
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,070
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

238
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,673
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

239
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,809
They're not human,
they're brutal!

240
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,811
You have to be ready.

241
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,921
Lord Baron.

242
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,125
Rabban.

243
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,895
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

244
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:49,264
It's done.

245
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:50,865
Very good.

246
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,937
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

247
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,073
How can the Emperor

248
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,709
take everything we've built

249
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:03,078
and give it to that Duke?

250
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:04,446
How?

251
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:07,449
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

252
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:11,319
What does he mean?

253
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,761
When is a gift not a gift?

254
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:25,066
The Atreides' voice is rising,

255
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:28,436
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

256
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,675
A dangerous, jealous man.

257
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,381
Paul.

258
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,584
Paul, wake up.

259
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,424
What's wrong?

260
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,827
Get dressed and come with me.

261
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,615
What is this?

262
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,618
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

263
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,854
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

264
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,457
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

265
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,426
She would like to meet you.

266
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,628
Why?

267
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,064
She wants to know
about your dreams.

268
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:39,267
How does she know
about my dreams?

269
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,471
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

270
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,940
He only needs a moment.

271
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,042
Hello, young master.

272
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,812
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

273
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,119
What's happening?

274
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,477
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

275
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:37,692
Paul...

276
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,326
Who are you?

277
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:17,966
Defiance in the eyes.

278
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,701
Like his father.

279
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,369
Leave us.

280
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,470
You must do everything

281
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:23,905
the Reverend Mother tells you.

282
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,877
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

283
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,144
Come here.

284
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:31,813
Kneel.

285
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,852
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

286
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,494
Put
your right hand in the box.

287
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:51,065
Your mother bade you obey me.

288
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:01,609
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

289
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,345
A poison needle.

290
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:05,713
Instant death.

291
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:08,283
The test is simple.

292
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,919
Remove your hand from the box

293
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,587
and you die.

294
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,290
What's in the box?

295
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,625
Pain.

296
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:22,430
-No need to call the guards.

297
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,132
Your mother stands
behind that door.

298
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,934
No one would get past her.

299
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,409
Why are you doing this?

300
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,478
An animal caught in a trap

301
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,381
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

302
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,383
What will you do?

303
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,417
-Silence.

304
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:25,159
-

305
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,095
I must not fear.

306
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,431
I must not fear.

307
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:38,706
Fear is the mind-killer.

308
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,043
Fear

309
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,512
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

310
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:47,215
-

311
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,050
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

312
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,284
to pass over me
and through me.

313
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,001
And when it has gone past...

314
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,546
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

315
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:24,318
And where the fear
has gone,

316
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,187
there will be nothing.

317
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,694
Only I will remain.

318
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,232
Enough.

319
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:40,535
-

320
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:57,452
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

321
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,121
we sift people.

322
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,091
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

323
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:04,759
like an animal,

324
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,061
we could not let you live.

325
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:09,797
You inherit too much power.

326
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,032
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

327
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,901
Because you are Jessica's son.

328
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:16,604
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

329
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,273
Jessica?

330
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:28,649
You've been training him
in the Way.

331
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,757
Tell me about these dreams.

332
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:37,959
-I had one tonight.
-What did you see?

333
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:42,263
A girl.

334
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,998
On Arrakis.

335
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,466
Have you dreamt of her before?

336
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:50,905
Many times.

337
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,643
Do you often dream
things that happen

338
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:56,911
just as you dreamed them?

339
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,616
Not exactly.

340
00:29:05,253 --> 00:29:06,854
Goodbye, young human.

341
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:09,290
I hope you live.

342
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,200
Did you have to go that far?

343
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,035
You chose
to train him in the Way,

344
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,037
in defiance of our rule.

345
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,672
He wields our power.

346
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,542
He had to be
tested to the limits.

347
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,878
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

348
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,947
You were told
to bear only daughters.

349
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:34,382
But you, in your pride,

350
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,384
thought you could
produce the  Kwisatz Haderach.

351
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,885
Was I wrong?

352
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,721
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

353
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,057
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

354
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,194
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

355
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:50,131
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

356
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,732
We have other prospects

357
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,202
if he fails his promise.

358
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:59,307
Do you see so little hope?

359
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:00,741
On Arrakis,
we have done

360
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,476
all we can for you.

361
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,378
A path has been laid.

362
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,714
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

363
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,296
Paul.

364
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:57,765
What does it mean?

365
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,801
That I could be The One?

366
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,236
You heard.

367
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:06,874
The Bene Gesserit serve

368
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:09,443
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

369
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:11,746
but there's more to it.

370
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:14,382
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

371
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:15,883
from the shadows.

372
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:17,585
I know.

373
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:20,121
You don't know everything.

374
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,490
For thousands of years,

375
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,226
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

376
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:27,428
-to bring forth...
-The One?

377
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,064
A mind...

378
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,137
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

379
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,773
Past and future.

380
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,077
Who can help us
into a better future.

381
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,948
We think he's very close now.

382
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:51,085
Some believe he's here.

383
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,091
All part of a plan.

384
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:16,230
Shield.

385
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:00,541
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

386
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,643
Blown past falling sand..."

387
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,422
Thufir Hawat.

388
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:54,395
Young master!

389
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:56,764
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

390
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,766
Exciting, to say the least.

391
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,335
My lord.

392
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,037
How are you, old friend?

393
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,439
My advance team
has secured the city.

394
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,542
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

395
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:11,512
My lady.

396
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,918
Lisan al-Gaib!

397
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:36,704
Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!

398
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:39,773
Lisan al-Gaib!

399
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:42,109
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

400
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:45,145
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

401
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:48,148
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

402
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,252
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

403
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,722
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

404
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:56,657
They follow
their old masters' rules.

405
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:57,891
Mandatory attendance.

406
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,261
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

407
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,335
Atreides!

408
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:12,006
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

409
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,843
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

410
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,412
Atreides! Atreides!

411
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:23,284
Let's get you
out of the sun.

412
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,853
The heat can kill
in this place.

413
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:43,837
They were pointing at us.

414
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,173
What are they shouting?

415
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:50,177
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

416
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:52,980
It's their name for "messiah."

417
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:56,350
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

418
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,886
Planting superstitions.

419
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,789
Preparing the way, Paul.

420
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:04,191
These people
have waited for centuries

421
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,026
for the  Lisan al-Gaib.

422
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:07,828
They see you,

423
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,564
they see the signs.

424
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,636
They see
what they've been told to see.

425
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:21,742
We're good to go.

426
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:06,587
Shield Wall.

427
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,555
Protects the city
from the weather

428
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,124
and the worms.

429
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,807
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

430
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,178
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

431
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:05,813
on our comms system.

432
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:10,484
It's so quiet.

433
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:13,587
Yeah.

434
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:15,522
That's what worries me, too.

435
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,031
There's the spaceport

436
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,767
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

437
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:28,936
Our two
most vulnerable points.

438
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,304
I want you guarding them.

439
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,006
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

440
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,142
-we're dead here.
- My lord.

441
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:37,845
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

442
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,718
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

443
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,287
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

444
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:48,889
That's what they say.

445
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,624
That's what they say.

446
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,865
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

447
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:15,148
What is your name?

448
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,384
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

449
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:21,221
The rest of you may go.

450
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:22,422
Thank you.

451
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,693
Shadout.

452
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,562
It's an old Chakobsa word.

453
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:30,764
"Well-dipper."

454
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:34,935
You know the ancient tongues?

455
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,503
I know many things.

456
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,740
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

457
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:43,510
If you mean to harm me,

458
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:46,079
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

459
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:48,682
it won't be enough.

460
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,920
The weapon is meant as a gift

461
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:56,056
if you are truly The One.

462
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:13,473
Do you know this?

463
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,443
It's a crysknife.

464
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,648
Do you know its meaning?

465
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:27,487
It's a maker...

466
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,062
A maker of the deep desert.

467
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:40,000
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

468
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,669
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

469
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,438
Lisan al-Gaib.

470
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:46,640
The mother and the son.

471
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,314
It is yours.

472
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:59,519
Tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

473
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,452
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

474
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,657
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

475
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,201
Hello.

476
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,306
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

477
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:57,711
They're out here.

478
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,414
Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

479
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,482
They don't care
about heatstroke.

480
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:07,421
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

481
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,657
Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

482
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:13,193
They can't survive without me.

483
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,494
Each one of these

484
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:17,164
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

485
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,934
Twenty palm trees.

486
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:24,771
A hundred lives.

487
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,907
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

488
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,408
No, no, no.

489
00:44:28,508 --> 00:44:30,077
These are sacred.

490
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:35,916
Old dream.

491
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,959
The largest and most dangerous

492
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,029
organism on Arrakis
is the sandworm,

493
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:53,233
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

494
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,702
To avoid making
rhythmic noises,

495
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,270
which attract the sandworms,

496
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:01,308
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

497
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:04,411
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

498
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:08,482
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

499
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:11,218
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

500
00:45:11,284 --> 00:45:12,886
is thanks to the Fremen,

501
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:15,889
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

502
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:18,992
such as saguaro, burrobush,

503
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:23,163
sand-verbena and incense bush.

504
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:26,500
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

505
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,104
stretching more than
450 feet deep.

506
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:33,073
These plants cling to life

507
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,443
in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.

508
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,315
It's a hunter-seeker.

509
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,417
The operator must be nearby.

510
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:56,923
The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

511
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,892
into that hole six weeks ago.

512
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:00,694
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe

513
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,862
inside the walls.

514
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:06,233
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

515
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,734
You have my resignation.

516
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,102
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

517
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,403
Sire, my honor demands...

518
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:12,205
They tried to take
the life of my son!

519
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,841
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

520
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,510
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

521
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:18,778
Your Grace.

522
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,355
The thing must leave.

523
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:30,924
You can speak
without fear.

524
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:33,293
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

525
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:34,861
Get out.

526
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,034
It understands.

527
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:42,636
Activate silence.

528
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:00,553
It must
never be known.

529
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,556
There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

530
00:48:03,623 --> 00:48:07,260
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

531
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:08,995
On that matter,

532
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,265
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

533
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:14,301
But his wife
is under our protection

534
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:17,003
and by extension, her son.

535
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,606
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

536
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,679
House Harkonnen
would never dream

537
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:28,748
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

538
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:31,451
I give you my word.

539
00:48:31,518 --> 00:48:33,186
We will not harm them.

540
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,975
If the Duke's son lives...

541
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,544
No Atreides will live.

542
00:48:57,644 --> 00:49:00,046
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

543
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,214
She sees too much.

544
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:03,049
I said I would not harm them.

545
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,384
And I shall not.

546
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,786
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

547
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:10,557
And the desert takes the weak.

548
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,893
My desert.

549
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,698
My Arrakis.

550
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:22,302
My Dune.

551
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,841
Your first
strategy meeting.

552
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:29,142
Paul Atreides,

553
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,144
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

554
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,345
like a hero of old.

555
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,916
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

556
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:38,318
Gotta keep an eye on you.

557
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,487
Attention!

558
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:49,863
Let's get started.

559
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:54,100
Thufir. Operations.

560
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,870
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

561
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:00,607
The Harkonnens were taking

562
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:04,177
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

563
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:06,913
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

564
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:08,515
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

565
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:10,950
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

566
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:13,219
Not with the equipment
they left us.

567
00:50:14,187 --> 00:50:15,789
How bad is it?

568
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:23,530
These are spice silos.

569
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,967
We're meant
to fill every crate.

570
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:29,969
All of them?

571
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,906
Every 25 standard days.

572
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:35,308
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

573
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:37,110
But who's
meant to arbitrate?

574
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,411
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

575
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:39,779
to oversee the transition?

576
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:41,281
Who did the Emperor appoint?

577
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:44,150
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

578
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,752
Been here 20 years.

579
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,654
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

580
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:50,790
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

581
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,258
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

582
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:54,794
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

583
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:56,329
A meeting's long overdue.

584
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,631
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

585
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,601
I love it.

586
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:02,769
Hmm.

587
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:05,105
-He's here, my lord.

588
00:51:29,028 --> 00:51:30,997
Take care
of them. They are friends.

589
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:32,031
Duncan!

590
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,500
Ah! My boy!

591
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,473
I swear you're getting taller.

592
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,208
Well,
you smell much worse.

593
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,881
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

594
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:49,048
Hidden in the desert,

595
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,850
in a community
called a  sietch.

596
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,218
Stilgar, the leader
of that  sietch,

597
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,120
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

598
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:56,523
This  sietch,  how is it hidden?

599
00:51:56,623 --> 00:51:57,690
It's underground.

600
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,726
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

601
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,494
How big was the place?

602
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:04,030
I'd say 10,000 people.

603
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,665
And there are
hundreds of  sietches.

604
00:52:06,866 --> 00:52:08,301
Millions of Fremen.

605
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,537
You were right.

606
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:13,973
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

607
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,242
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

608
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,810
I never saw them.

609
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:20,580
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

610
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,248
And I gotta tell you,

611
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,751
I have never come
so close to dying.

612
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,654
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

613
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,322
They fight like demons.

614
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:31,257
Desert power.

615
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,428
Duncan.

616
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,996
-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

617
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,431
Sire.

618
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:41,100
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

619
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:44,270
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

620
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,572
Let him pass.

621
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:03,590
Stop there.

622
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,358
Hey! Hey!

623
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:09,929
Mm.

624
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,931
Stilgar.

625
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,067
Welcome.

626
00:53:15,268 --> 00:53:17,637
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

627
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,539
of any man that respects mine.

628
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:23,876
Hmm.

629
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,615
Hold.

630
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:31,784
Thank you, Stilgar,

631
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:35,288
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

632
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:37,724
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

633
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:46,799
I'm glad you've come.

634
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,669
I believe your people and mine

635
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,070
have much
to offer one another.

636
00:53:51,137 --> 00:53:52,505
No, no, you are Outworlders.

637
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,274
You come here for the spice,

638
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,809
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

639
00:53:58,578 --> 00:53:59,612
That's true.

640
00:54:01,514 --> 00:54:04,450
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

641
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,086
Name what you want.

642
00:54:07,153 --> 00:54:08,354
If it's in my power to grant,

643
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,922
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

644
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:12,859
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our  sietches.

645
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,795
Do not trespass in our lands.

646
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:19,332
The desert was ours
long before you came.

647
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:21,200
So, come and dig your spice,

648
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:22,502
but when you have it,

649
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:24,704
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

650
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,606
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

651
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:29,475
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

652
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:32,145
Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

653
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:33,546
The Emperor

654
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,382
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

655
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,217
to rule and protect.

656
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:40,820
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

657
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:43,723
if duty compels me.

658
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:46,726
But your  sietches
will be yours forever.

659
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:49,395
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

660
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,735
That's very honorable.

661
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,504
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

662
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,740
Won't you stay?

663
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,208
We would honor you.

664
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:05,378
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

665
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:18,324
I don't like him.

666
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:20,660
Our plan bears fruit.

667
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,161
But it will take time?

668
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:23,496
Yes.

669
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,733
It will take time.

670
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:30,870
Here, this is for you.

671
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:36,943
It's a paracompass.

672
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:39,545
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

673
00:55:39,612 --> 00:55:42,248
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

674
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,450
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

675
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,219
The Fremen make these?

676
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:48,121
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

677
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,622
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

678
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,691
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

679
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:54,961
That's a sand compactor.

680
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:58,965
My God, man,
you've gone native.

681
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,366
You admire them.

682
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:03,136
I do.

683
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,905
They're fierce but loyal.

684
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:07,774
They're attuned to the desert.

685
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:09,108
Part of it.

686
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,310
It's part of them.

687
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,578
You wait till you see it.

688
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:14,814
It's beautiful out there.

689
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:20,119
Sunrise warning, all workers.

690
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,156
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

691
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:24,991
We are currently 90 degrees,

692
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:28,461
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

693
00:56:29,562 --> 00:56:30,830
Last warning call.

694
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,299
The Judge of the Change, sire.

695
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:08,334
Dr. Liet Kynes.

696
00:57:08,434 --> 00:57:09,836
My lord Duke.

697
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,205
Welcome to Arrakis.

698
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:14,373
You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

699
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:16,375
Thank you for the stillsuits.

700
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,544
They are of Fremen make.

701
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:19,712
The best.

702
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,113
With your permission, sire,

703
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,548
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

704
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,783
Whoa.

705
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,685
It's all right.

706
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,522
It's all right.

707
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:33,192
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

708
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:38,898
A stillsuit

709
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,969
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

710
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:44,637
Even this early
in the morning,

711
00:57:44,704 --> 00:57:47,507
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

712
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:50,676
It cools the body

713
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:54,580
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

714
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,984
Your body's movements
provide the power.

715
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,752
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

716
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,921
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

717
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,256
Mm.

718
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:04,690
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

719
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:07,059
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

720
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,494
Most impressive.

721
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,531
Let's have a look at you, lad.

722
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,268
You've...

723
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:16,569
worn a stillsuit before?

724
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,271
No, this is my first time.

725
00:58:20,506 --> 00:58:23,109
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

726
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,044
Who taught you to do that?

727
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:27,179
It seemed the right way.

728
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:35,955
Are you Fremen?

729
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:41,627
I am accepted
in both  sietch  and village.

730
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,397
Now, come and see
the spice sands

731
00:58:44,463 --> 00:58:47,533
on which
your livelihood depends.

732
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:26,672
What would you do

733
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,307
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

734
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:30,509
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

735
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,178
It's worm territory.

736
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:35,915
Dust cloud.

737
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:39,185
I see it.

738
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:41,420
That's one of your harvesters.

739
01:00:07,346 --> 01:00:08,514
You can see the spice

740
01:00:08,614 --> 01:00:10,483
scattered over the surface.

741
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:13,986
A rich spice bed

742
01:00:14,053 --> 01:00:15,521
by the color.

743
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:18,124
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

744
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,474
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

745
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,711
Wormsign?

746
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:41,080
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

747
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,382
Worms travel deep
but get closer

748
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:44,850
to the surface
when they attack.

749
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:47,153
If you are patient,

750
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,089
we should see one.

751
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:51,657
A worm always comes?

752
01:00:51,724 --> 01:00:54,527
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

753
01:00:54,593 --> 01:00:56,696
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

754
01:00:56,762 --> 01:00:59,265
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

755
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,599
It attracts the worms

756
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,369
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

757
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,173
Is that a worm?

758
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:21,187
Big one.

759
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:23,589
You have good eyes.

760
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:25,925
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

761
01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:28,527
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

762
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:31,297
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

763
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:32,431
Over.

764
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:33,933
They seem pretty calm
about it.

765
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:36,535
Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

766
01:01:36,602 --> 01:01:38,771
Wormsign north
and east of you.

767
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,873
3.7 kilometers.

768
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,475
Delta Ajax niner,

769
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:44,376
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

770
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,047
Stand by for contact fix.

771
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:54,153
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

772
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,821
Contact in five minutes.

773
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,723
So, what happens now?

774
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,326
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

775
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:02,561
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

776
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:04,263
Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.

777
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,165
Ready for docking sequence.

778
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:08,734
Contact five minutes. Over.

779
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,241
Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

780
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,946
There it is.

781
01:02:21,013 --> 01:02:22,348
This is carryall Alpha Zero

782
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:24,784
to Delta Ajax niner.

783
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,919
Approaching from your east.

784
01:02:26,986 --> 01:02:29,855
Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.

785
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:33,459
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

786
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:36,996
T-5.

787
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:38,531
Copy that.

788
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,366
Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.

789
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,768
Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.

790
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,174
Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

791
01:02:48,274 --> 01:02:49,708
What is going on?

792
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,811
It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.

793
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:54,180
Shit.

794
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,315
Carryall
unable to receive.

795
01:02:56,382 --> 01:02:58,284
Unable to lift
without that anchor.

796
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,052
All call! All call!

797
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,122
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

798
01:03:03,189 --> 01:03:05,157
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

799
01:03:05,224 --> 01:03:06,692
Hydraulics are dead.

800
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:08,360
We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.

801
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,528
Contact in four minutes.

802
01:03:09,628 --> 01:03:10,563
Try it again!

803
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:11,363
How many men on that crawler?

804
01:03:11,463 --> 01:03:12,531
Crew of 21.

805
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,632
Our ships
can take six each.

806
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:14,867
That's still three short.

807
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:16,635
We'll find a way.

808
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:31,183
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

809
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,887
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

810
01:03:34,987 --> 01:03:36,989
We'll set down on the west.

811
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:49,268
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

812
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,403
Yes, Gurney,

813
01:03:51,503 --> 01:03:52,771
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

814
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,406
Yes, sire.

815
01:03:54,506 --> 01:03:56,075
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

816
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:57,243
Guide them in.

817
01:03:57,343 --> 01:03:58,544
Delta Ajax niner,

818
01:03:58,611 --> 01:04:01,113
put seven men each
in my ships now.

819
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,473
Contact in two minutes.

820
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:06,412
Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.

821
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,082
Where are they?

822
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:12,184
Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.

823
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,987
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

824
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:16,689
Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.

825
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,824
-We can't just leave it.
-Damn the spice!

826
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:21,527
I want every man
off that crawler now!

827
01:05:35,507 --> 01:05:36,608
Hey!

828
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:37,776
Hey!

829
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,379
Seven over here,
seven over there.

830
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,717
Go! Go! Go!

831
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:02,634
Kwisatz Haderach.

832
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:19,251
Kwisatz Haderach  awakes.

833
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:30,095
Hurry! Get on!

834
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:39,872
It's here!

835
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:43,876
Paul!

836
01:06:46,345 --> 01:06:47,579
Paul!

837
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,853
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

838
01:06:55,521 --> 01:06:57,089
Get up!

839
01:06:57,189 --> 01:06:59,725
Let's go!

840
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:02,428
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

841
01:07:02,528 --> 01:07:03,762
Run!

842
01:07:29,455 --> 01:07:30,489
Hey!

843
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:51,443
Bless the Maker and His Water.

844
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,745
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

845
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:56,748
May His passage
cleanse the world

846
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:59,318
and keep the world
for His people.

847
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,543
Hey!

848
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,678
-You cannot take such risks.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:08:26,778 --> 01:08:28,046
You have responsibilities.

850
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,281
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

851
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:30,349
Go.

852
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:32,484
Dr. Kynes.

853
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,155
You saw it.

854
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:38,223
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

855
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,559
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

856
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:42,561
We've been set up to fail.

857
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:45,364
That carryall was just old.

858
01:08:45,464 --> 01:08:47,499
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

859
01:08:49,368 --> 01:08:50,903
You know what will happen

860
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:53,505
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

861
01:08:55,474 --> 01:08:59,311
I'm not here
to take your part.

862
01:08:59,378 --> 01:09:03,415
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

863
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:09,688
Take good care of your family.

864
01:09:13,025 --> 01:09:16,161
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

865
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:35,614
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

866
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:38,750
You seem to be sensitive.

867
01:09:43,121 --> 01:09:44,189
You'll be fine.

868
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:47,926
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

869
01:09:57,302 --> 01:09:59,805
That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

870
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,408
I had a vision.

871
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,646
My eyes were wide open.

872
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:10,649
What did you see?

873
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,857
Kwisatz Haderach.

874
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:54,993
You can see.

875
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:38,070
It's confusing.

876
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,705
I thought I saw my death,

877
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:41,973
only it wasn't.

878
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,911
I know a knife is important,
somehow.

879
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:50,215
Someone will hand me a blade,

880
01:11:50,315 --> 01:11:54,019
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

881
01:11:56,088 --> 01:11:59,091
Some things, though,
are crystal clear.

882
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,525
I can feel it.

883
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,765
I know you're pregnant.

884
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,673
You can't know that.

885
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,409
I barely know that.

886
01:12:17,509 --> 01:12:19,511
It's only been a few weeks.

887
01:12:29,688 --> 01:12:32,257
[priest throat-singing
in Sardaukar]

888
01:13:10,629 --> 01:13:11,897
Atreides legions

889
01:13:11,963 --> 01:13:14,299
are the finest
in the Imperium.

890
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:16,768
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

891
01:13:25,243 --> 01:13:26,678
Just so.

892
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:29,247
Three battalions.

893
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:30,348
As agreed.

894
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,058
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

895
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:15,060
No.

896
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,562
Don't think I want to know.

897
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,664
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

898
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:21,566
he hasn't been the same.

899
01:14:23,235 --> 01:14:24,536
He's distracted.

900
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:29,574
Jessica, you gave me a son.

901
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,042
And from the moment
he was born,

902
01:14:31,142 --> 01:14:33,011
I never questioned you.

903
01:14:33,078 --> 01:14:35,547
I trusted you completely.

904
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,816
Even when
you walked in shadows.

905
01:14:38,984 --> 01:14:40,919
Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

906
01:14:43,555 --> 01:14:45,724
If anything happens...

907
01:14:46,825 --> 01:14:48,193
will you protect our son?

908
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:51,429
With my life.

909
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,932
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

910
01:14:58,169 --> 01:15:00,205
Will you protect Paul?

911
01:15:05,777 --> 01:15:07,779
Why are you
having these thoughts?

912
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:16,788
Leto, this is not you.

913
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:24,796
I thought we'd have more time.

914
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,384
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

915
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:48,386
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

916
01:15:57,662 --> 01:15:59,097
You need to sleep.

917
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:02,300
No.

918
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,668
Not like that.

919
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,186
I should have married you.

920
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:41,199
Hawat. Security.

921
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:44,936
Security.

922
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:49,501
Sir. Sir.

923
01:18:50,401 --> 01:18:52,170
The shield's come down.

924
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,506
-

925
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:03,014
God in heaven.

926
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:06,084
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

927
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:51,863
Go! Go! Go!

928
01:20:53,758 --> 01:20:55,760
With me! With me!

929
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:25,823
Atreides!

930
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,091
Atreides!

931
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:58,323
Sardaukar!
- Sardaukar!

932
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:23,481
I'm sorry, my lord.

933
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:29,287
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

934
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:32,824
Why?

935
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:35,727
I had no choice.

936
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:39,664
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

937
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:42,300
They take her apart
like a doll.

938
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,403
I will buy her freedom.

939
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:47,071
And you are the price.

940
01:22:50,408 --> 01:22:53,478
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

941
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,880
And you

942
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,849
will kill a man for me.

943
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:05,757
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

944
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:10,762
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

945
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:15,099
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

946
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,902
It will be your last breath.

947
01:23:18,002 --> 01:23:20,338
But if you choose
your moment well,

948
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:23,908
it will also be the Baron's.

949
01:24:57,635 --> 01:24:58,703
Paul.

950
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,287
To hell, dogs!

951
01:27:58,883 --> 01:28:01,686
I've never had a highborn.

952
01:28:04,055 --> 01:28:05,389
You?

953
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,558
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

954
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:11,462
She's highborn enough for me.

955
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:13,798
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

956
01:28:13,864 --> 01:28:15,866
And give her a long goodbye.

957
01:28:15,966 --> 01:28:17,735
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

958
01:28:19,203 --> 01:28:20,237
Don't talk.

959
01:28:31,582 --> 01:28:33,084
Remove her gag.

960
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:43,994
Shut up.

961
01:29:12,923 --> 01:29:14,191
Remove her gag.

962
01:29:20,264 --> 01:29:21,465
Kill him.

963
01:29:30,441 --> 01:29:31,609
Set us free.

964
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,424
Stop!

965
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:48,058
Cut the rope.

966
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:52,229
Give me the knife.

967
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:04,008
Your pitch was too forced.

968
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,484
It's a fremkit.

969
01:30:26,464 --> 01:30:27,665
They've crippled the ship.

970
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:41,872
Mmm.

971
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,592
Ah.

972
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,130
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

973
01:32:24,315 --> 01:32:27,151
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

974
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,820
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

975
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,056
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

976
01:32:32,122 --> 01:32:34,892
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

977
01:32:42,232 --> 01:32:43,267
My lord Baron.

978
01:32:44,668 --> 01:32:45,836
Dr. Yueh.

979
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:47,605
The traitor.

980
01:32:48,806 --> 01:32:49,940
What do you want?

981
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:53,344
I jammed their comms

982
01:32:53,444 --> 01:32:55,446
and lowered their shields.

983
01:32:55,512 --> 01:32:56,780
Hmm.

984
01:32:56,847 --> 01:32:59,116
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

985
01:32:59,183 --> 01:33:01,685
The bargain
to the letter.

986
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,288
And what was I to do for you?

987
01:33:04,355 --> 01:33:06,523
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

988
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:09,526
Yes.

989
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:45,629
I said I'd set her free.

990
01:33:45,696 --> 01:33:47,531
That you could join her.

991
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:53,570
So, join her.

992
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,539
-

993
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:04,715
What do you think is next?

994
01:34:08,385 --> 01:34:10,688
It's a thumper.

995
01:34:10,754 --> 01:34:12,356
No stillsuits.

996
01:34:12,423 --> 01:34:14,358
The one thing
we actually need.

997
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:23,033
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

998
01:34:24,234 --> 01:34:25,903
But no more.

999
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:31,608
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1000
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:34,578
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

1001
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:40,451
And your bloodline
ends forever.

1002
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:54,698
What did you say?

1003
01:35:04,742 --> 01:35:06,210
Here I am...

1004
01:35:07,478 --> 01:35:09,279
here I remain.

1005
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:16,086
-

1006
01:36:52,516 --> 01:36:53,717
Kynes!

1007
01:36:54,985 --> 01:36:56,753
It's not safe for you here.

1008
01:36:56,854 --> 01:36:58,088
Will you tell
the Great Houses

1009
01:36:58,188 --> 01:36:59,656
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1010
01:36:59,723 --> 01:37:02,326
How the best of them
were murdered?

1011
01:37:02,392 --> 01:37:05,062
I am commanded to say nothing.

1012
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,731
To see nothing.

1013
01:37:09,566 --> 01:37:11,935
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1014
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:02,552
There's spice
in the tent.

1015
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:31,141
That's the future.
It's coming.

1016
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:47,891
Holy war
spreading across the universe

1017
01:39:47,991 --> 01:39:49,259
like unquenchable fire.

1018
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:05,108
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1019
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:08,278
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1020
01:40:17,254 --> 01:40:19,756
Somebody help me, please.

1021
01:40:20,457 --> 01:40:21,625
Paul.

1022
01:40:23,927 --> 01:40:25,629
It's coming.

1023
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:27,130
I see a holy war spreading

1024
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,132
across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1025
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:32,235
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1026
01:40:32,302 --> 01:40:33,470
in my father's name.

1027
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,471
Paul.

1028
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:36,239
Fanatical legions worshipping

1029
01:40:36,306 --> 01:40:38,475
at the shrine
of my father's skull.

1030
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:41,778
A war in my name!

1031
01:40:41,878 --> 01:40:43,713
Everyone's shouting my name!

1032
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:44,781
Paul.

1033
01:40:48,452 --> 01:40:50,554
Paul Atreides.

1034
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,590
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1035
01:40:53,657 --> 01:40:57,160
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1036
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:00,063
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1037
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,298
Get off me!

1038
01:41:03,233 --> 01:41:04,901
You did this to me!

1039
01:41:04,968 --> 01:41:07,671
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1040
01:41:32,796 --> 01:41:35,098
My father is dead.

1041
01:42:11,568 --> 01:42:13,069
Someone's near.

1042
01:42:14,004 --> 01:42:15,505
You need to drink.

1043
01:42:17,073 --> 01:42:19,376
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1044
01:42:27,184 --> 01:42:28,985
Sweat and tears.

1045
01:42:32,656 --> 01:42:34,357
All right,
let's get out of here.

1046
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:49,332
That's Duncan.

1047
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:57,674
Duncan.

1048
01:43:59,309 --> 01:44:00,510
My lady.

1049
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:02,012
Paul.

1050
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:04,481
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1051
01:44:04,581 --> 01:44:05,782
We know.

1052
01:44:07,684 --> 01:44:09,019
My lord Duke.

1053
01:44:22,799 --> 01:44:23,800
Here.

1054
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:27,370
Drink this.

1055
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:37,013
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1056
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:38,548
on the planet at once.

1057
01:44:38,648 --> 01:44:40,784
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1058
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:42,886
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1059
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:45,522
-At least two battalions.
-What? Are you sure?

1060
01:44:45,622 --> 01:44:48,291
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1061
01:44:48,358 --> 01:44:49,726
you know it.

1062
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:54,564
So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1063
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:57,801
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1064
01:44:57,867 --> 01:44:59,903
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1065
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,971
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1066
01:45:20,423 --> 01:45:22,359
-

1067
01:45:22,425 --> 01:45:24,160
Storm's coming.

1068
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:40,276
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1069
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:41,511
We'll be safe here.

1070
01:45:43,046 --> 01:45:45,281
Do you know
what this place is?

1071
01:45:45,382 --> 01:45:47,784
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1072
01:45:51,187 --> 01:45:53,022
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1073
01:45:53,089 --> 01:45:55,525
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1074
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:01,131
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1075
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:02,365
The work had begun,

1076
01:46:02,432 --> 01:46:04,100
but then the spice
was discovered.

1077
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,203
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1078
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:08,471
Tanat,

1079
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,140
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1080
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,474
TANAT: Yes, Liet.

1081
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:12,976
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1082
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:14,544
SHAMIR: Of course, Liet.

1083
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,782
Who are you to the Fremen?

1084
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:10,533
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1085
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:12,202
Dr. Kynes?

1086
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:15,705
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1087
01:47:16,706 --> 01:47:17,874
The Sardaukar coming

1088
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:19,676
and picking them off
one by one.

1089
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,280
Only together
can they stand a chance

1090
01:47:24,347 --> 01:47:25,849
against the Imperium.

1091
01:47:27,884 --> 01:47:30,053
Would you bear witness?

1092
01:47:30,153 --> 01:47:33,289
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1093
01:47:33,356 --> 01:47:36,292
If they believe me,

1094
01:47:36,359 --> 01:47:38,061
there would be general warfare

1095
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:40,363
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1096
01:47:40,463 --> 01:47:42,031
Chaos

1097
01:47:42,131 --> 01:47:43,566
across the Imperium.

1098
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,068
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1099
01:47:45,168 --> 01:47:47,637
with an alternative to chaos.

1100
01:47:47,704 --> 01:47:49,639
The Emperor has no sons.

1101
01:47:49,706 --> 01:47:51,708
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1102
01:47:51,808 --> 01:47:54,577
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1103
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:56,412
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1104
01:47:56,513 --> 01:47:58,181
He brought you here
to kill you.

1105
01:47:58,248 --> 01:48:00,750
What don't you understand?

1106
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:04,020
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1107
01:48:08,224 --> 01:48:10,994
The Fremen speak
of the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1108
01:48:11,995 --> 01:48:13,830
Careful.

1109
01:48:13,897 --> 01:48:15,064
The Voice from the Outer World

1110
01:48:15,164 --> 01:48:17,333
who will lead them
to paradise.

1111
01:48:18,668 --> 01:48:19,869
Superstition.

1112
01:48:24,674 --> 01:48:26,409
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1113
01:48:26,509 --> 01:48:27,777
and lost him in battle.

1114
01:48:31,014 --> 01:48:34,717
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1115
01:48:39,956 --> 01:48:41,858
I've seen your dream.

1116
01:48:45,962 --> 01:48:47,196
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1117
01:48:47,263 --> 01:48:49,198
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1118
01:48:49,265 --> 01:48:50,800
with a wave of my hand.

1119
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:44,320
-

1120
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:46,089
-

1121
01:50:46,582 --> 01:50:47,650
Sardaukar!

1122
01:50:50,753 --> 01:50:51,988
No! Duncan!

1123
01:50:52,055 --> 01:50:53,322
Paul, no!

1124
01:50:53,389 --> 01:50:54,691
Duncan, no!
- No!

1125
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:57,160
No!
- Paul, no!

1126
01:50:58,361 --> 01:50:59,662
Duncan, no!

1127
01:50:59,729 --> 01:51:02,198
-He's locked the door.
- Duncan! No!

1128
01:51:51,581 --> 01:51:53,149
He's gone.

1129
01:51:53,249 --> 01:51:54,317
Duncan!

1130
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:55,985
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1131
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:05,995
Paul, go! Paul!

1132
01:52:24,914 --> 01:52:26,582
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1133
01:52:57,947 --> 01:52:59,615
Follow the light.

1134
01:52:59,682 --> 01:53:01,884
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1135
01:53:01,984 --> 01:53:03,853
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1136
01:53:03,953 --> 01:53:06,522
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1137
01:53:06,622 --> 01:53:10,726
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1138
01:53:10,827 --> 01:53:12,061
Are you not coming with us?

1139
01:53:12,161 --> 01:53:13,362
It only seats two.

1140
01:53:13,462 --> 01:53:15,164
I'll go to the next station

1141
01:53:15,231 --> 01:53:16,966
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1142
01:53:17,033 --> 01:53:18,334
How?

1143
01:53:19,068 --> 01:53:21,003
I'm Fremen.

1144
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:23,306
The desert's my home.

1145
01:53:23,372 --> 01:53:24,473
Good luck.

1146
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,741
Good luck.

1147
01:55:39,942 --> 01:55:41,510
-

1148
01:56:06,836 --> 01:56:09,238
I serve only one master.

1149
01:56:09,338 --> 01:56:12,675
His name is  Shai-Hulud.

1150
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:36,999
-

1151
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,288
There are jet flares
behind us.

1152
01:57:33,122 --> 01:57:35,057
Paul. We're not high enough!

1153
01:57:45,334 --> 01:57:46,802
-

1154
01:57:49,972 --> 01:57:51,941
-

1155
01:57:58,514 --> 01:58:00,749
-

1156
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,125
I must not fear.

1157
01:58:09,191 --> 01:58:10,860
Fear is the mind-killer.

1158
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,697
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1159
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:23,272
See the friend.

1160
01:58:27,042 --> 01:58:29,945
See the friend.

1161
01:58:32,648 --> 01:58:35,451
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1162
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:41,023
but a reality to experience.

1163
01:58:44,326 --> 01:58:46,562
A process
that cannot be understood

1164
01:58:46,662 --> 01:58:48,898
by stopping it.

1165
01:58:48,998 --> 01:58:51,400
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1166
01:58:52,368 --> 01:58:54,870
We must join it.

1167
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:56,739
We must flow with it.

1168
01:58:56,839 --> 01:58:58,474
Let go.

1169
01:58:58,541 --> 01:59:00,543
Let go.

1170
01:59:44,687 --> 01:59:47,289
-

1171
01:59:47,389 --> 01:59:51,527
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1172
01:59:53,028 --> 01:59:55,598
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

1173
02:00:00,269 --> 02:00:02,571
Nothing survives such a storm.

1174
02:00:02,638 --> 02:00:04,073
They're dead.

1175
02:00:05,474 --> 02:00:07,309
It's a certainty.

1176
02:00:14,316 --> 02:00:16,619
So, it's done. Finally.

1177
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:20,589
Send word to Giedi Prime

1178
02:00:20,656 --> 02:00:23,492
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

1179
02:00:24,326 --> 02:00:26,428
But slowly.

1180
02:00:26,495 --> 02:00:29,164
We don't want
the price to fall.

1181
02:00:29,265 --> 02:00:30,766
You have no idea
how much it cost me

1182
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:33,335
to bring such a force
to bear here.

1183
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:36,305
Now I only have
one requirement.

1184
02:00:36,405 --> 02:00:37,506
Income.

1185
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,142
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1186
02:00:40,909 --> 02:00:42,344
Squeeze hard.

1187
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:43,812
Yes, Uncle.

1188
02:00:45,414 --> 02:00:46,515
And the Fremen?

1189
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:49,084
Kill them all.

1190
02:01:12,141 --> 02:01:14,109
We're above
5,000 meters.

1191
02:01:54,683 --> 02:01:56,652
-

1192
02:02:51,874 --> 02:02:53,809
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1193
02:04:46,989 --> 02:04:48,824
And breathe through this.

1194
02:05:19,021 --> 02:05:21,290
Now
we have to find the Fremen.

1195
02:05:22,858 --> 02:05:24,192
Are you good?

1196
02:05:24,259 --> 02:05:25,627
Yeah.

1197
02:06:32,494 --> 02:06:34,262
Paul...

1198
02:06:40,802 --> 02:06:44,640
Don't be frightened.

1199
02:06:44,706 --> 02:06:47,943
Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

1200
02:06:48,977 --> 02:06:52,147
Don't be frightened.

1201
02:06:52,214 --> 02:06:54,049
You'll need
to face your fears.

1202
02:06:54,149 --> 02:06:55,717
A friend...

1203
02:06:55,817 --> 02:06:58,954
A friend will help you.

1204
02:07:00,322 --> 02:07:02,157
Follow the friend.

1205
02:07:04,993 --> 02:07:06,328
You have much to learn.

1206
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:11,333
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1207
02:07:14,670 --> 02:07:16,238
Come with me.

1208
02:07:43,865 --> 02:07:47,602
The  sietch
where Duncan lived

1209
02:07:47,703 --> 02:07:49,871
is somewhere off that way.

1210
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:55,043
I can see
greenery over there.

1211
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:56,278
There.

1212
02:07:56,378 --> 02:07:58,380
That means
Fremen live there.

1213
02:08:02,718 --> 02:08:04,853
We'll cross after dark.

1214
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,922
That's how the Fremen do it.

1215
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:12,394
We're about to enter
worm territory.

1216
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:14,296
We can't walk
like regular humans.

1217
02:08:14,396 --> 02:08:15,797
If we do, we're dead.

1218
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:17,899
We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.

1219
02:08:17,966 --> 02:08:19,534
It's called a sandwalk.

1220
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:22,270
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1221
02:08:22,370 --> 02:08:23,772
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1222
02:08:23,872 --> 02:08:25,407
Okay. Follow me.

1223
02:08:25,474 --> 02:08:27,242
Do the same moves.

1224
02:08:40,422 --> 02:08:42,057
I think this is
the right direction.

1225
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:05,707
It's close by.

1226
02:10:06,575 --> 02:10:08,510
Let's get out of here.

1227
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:12,214
-Wait.

1228
02:10:12,314 --> 02:10:14,182
-It's drum sand.

1229
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:20,755
-  run.

1230
02:10:26,695 --> 02:10:28,396
Go! Go!

1231
02:11:40,502 --> 02:11:41,636
It's a thumper.

1232
02:11:46,942 --> 02:11:48,944
Someone set off a thumper.

1233
02:12:03,491 --> 02:12:05,760
Paul! Run!

1234
02:12:20,442 --> 02:12:21,776
How big are they?

1235
02:12:21,843 --> 02:12:23,044
That was insane.

1236
02:12:27,782 --> 02:12:29,317
Someone called it.

1237
02:13:01,249 --> 02:13:03,818
Do not run.

1238
02:13:03,885 --> 02:13:06,521
You will only waste
your body's water.

1239
02:13:07,522 --> 02:13:08,556
Hold.

1240
02:13:16,231 --> 02:13:17,098
Stilgar.

1241
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:18,767
-Hey!

1242
02:13:18,867 --> 02:13:20,101
You know me. I was there

1243
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:21,936
when you came
to my father's Council.

1244
02:13:22,037 --> 02:13:23,004
Oh.

1245
02:13:23,071 --> 02:13:25,106
This is the Duke's son.

1246
02:13:25,206 --> 02:13:26,841
Why are you waiting?

1247
02:13:26,908 --> 02:13:28,777
We need their water.

1248
02:13:28,877 --> 02:13:31,112
This is the boy
I told you about.

1249
02:13:31,212 --> 02:13:32,447
We can't touch him.

1250
02:13:36,851 --> 02:13:38,219
They are weaklings.

1251
02:13:38,286 --> 02:13:40,055
Jamis.

1252
02:13:40,121 --> 02:13:42,023
That was a brave crossing
they made

1253
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:44,959
in the path of  Shai-Hulud.

1254
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:48,196
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1255
02:13:49,230 --> 02:13:50,932
Nor did his father.

1256
02:13:51,032 --> 02:13:53,635
My thumper
saved his life.

1257
02:13:53,735 --> 02:13:56,204
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1258
02:13:56,271 --> 02:13:57,972
He's not The One.

1259
02:14:00,742 --> 02:14:02,410
We have powerful friends.

1260
02:14:02,477 --> 02:14:05,647
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1261
02:14:05,747 --> 02:14:06,981
you will be well rewarded.

1262
02:14:07,082 --> 02:14:09,884
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1263
02:14:09,951 --> 02:14:11,486
in your flesh?

1264
02:14:14,289 --> 02:14:16,324
Hmm...

1265
02:14:16,424 --> 02:14:18,059
The boy is young.

1266
02:14:18,126 --> 02:14:20,328
He can learn our ways.

1267
02:14:20,428 --> 02:14:23,064
He may have sanctuary.

1268
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:25,467
But the woman is untrained...

1269
02:14:28,136 --> 02:14:29,637
and too old to learn.

1270
02:15:01,002 --> 02:15:03,138
- back, you dogs.

1271
02:15:04,772 --> 02:15:06,975
She'll cut my throat.

1272
02:15:11,946 --> 02:15:14,449
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1273
02:15:14,516 --> 02:15:16,184
And a fighter?

1274
02:15:16,284 --> 02:15:18,453
Conversation ran short.

1275
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,722
Peace, woman.

1276
02:15:20,822 --> 02:15:22,157
Peace.

1277
02:15:22,957 --> 02:15:24,492
I judged hastily.

1278
02:16:03,698 --> 02:16:06,100
I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

1279
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:33,962
They say you're the  Mahdi.

1280
02:16:34,062 --> 02:16:35,897
But you look
like a little boy.

1281
02:16:37,398 --> 02:16:38,866
You chose the hardest way up.

1282
02:16:38,933 --> 02:16:40,268
Follow me.

1283
02:16:47,742 --> 02:16:49,310
Give it to me.

1284
02:16:56,251 --> 02:16:57,952
You will have
your own maula pistol

1285
02:16:58,052 --> 02:16:59,954
when you've earned it.

1286
02:17:00,054 --> 02:17:01,089
Give it to me.

1287
02:17:06,828 --> 02:17:08,963
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1288
02:17:09,063 --> 02:17:11,666
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1289
02:17:11,766 --> 02:17:13,167
I will not have them.

1290
02:17:20,108 --> 02:17:21,509
Jamis,

1291
02:17:21,609 --> 02:17:23,945
I have spoken. Be still.

1292
02:17:24,012 --> 02:17:25,613
You talk like a leader.

1293
02:17:26,614 --> 02:17:28,483
But the strongest leads.

1294
02:17:29,784 --> 02:17:31,586
She bested you.

1295
02:17:32,987 --> 02:17:35,289
I invoke the amtal.

1296
02:17:35,356 --> 02:17:37,792
You may not challenge
a  Sayyadina.

1297
02:17:37,859 --> 02:17:39,360
Then who will fight
in her name?

1298
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:42,196
Jamis, don't do this.

1299
02:17:42,297 --> 02:17:44,365
Don't. The night is fading.

1300
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:47,368
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1301
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:49,504
Where is her champion?

1302
02:18:00,348 --> 02:18:02,350
I accept her champion.

1303
02:18:34,515 --> 02:18:38,419
Paul Atreides
must die...

1304
02:18:40,188 --> 02:18:44,892
for  Kwisatz Haderach  to rise.

1305
02:18:47,562 --> 02:18:51,265
Don't be frightened.

1306
02:18:51,366 --> 02:18:52,934
Don't resist.

1307
02:18:59,006 --> 02:19:00,942
When you take a life,

1308
02:19:01,876 --> 02:19:04,011
you take your own.

1309
02:19:35,777 --> 02:19:38,246
I don't believe
you're the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1310
02:19:39,747 --> 02:19:41,783
But I want you
to die with honor.

1311
02:19:53,261 --> 02:19:56,097
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1312
02:19:59,333 --> 02:20:01,736
It's made
from a tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

1313
02:20:01,803 --> 02:20:03,504
The great sandworm.

1314
02:20:05,139 --> 02:20:07,942
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1315
02:20:12,246 --> 02:20:14,615
Where is the Outworlder?

1316
02:20:18,953 --> 02:20:20,855
Jamis is a good fighter.

1317
02:20:21,823 --> 02:20:23,491
He won't let you suffer.

1318
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:26,594
Chani...

1319
02:20:29,697 --> 02:20:30,765
Um...

1320
02:20:38,806 --> 02:20:40,007
Never mind.

1321
02:21:35,363 --> 02:21:37,532
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1322
02:21:45,339 --> 02:21:47,275
You should welcome my blade.

1323
02:21:50,778 --> 02:21:52,547
This world will kill you.

1324
02:21:55,917 --> 02:21:57,451
Quicker this way.

1325
02:22:08,396 --> 02:22:11,265
-

1326
02:22:37,091 --> 02:22:38,726
-Do you yield?
-

1327
02:22:40,962 --> 02:22:42,830
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1328
02:22:44,265 --> 02:22:45,833
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1329
02:22:45,933 --> 02:22:47,602
Only death is the test of it.

1330
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:57,945
-Is he toying with him?
-No.

1331
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:00,948
Paul has never killed a man.

1332
02:23:11,692 --> 02:23:16,130
Kwisatz Haderach.

1333
02:23:19,166 --> 02:23:22,203
Kwisatz Haderach.

1334
02:23:22,303 --> 02:23:26,173
Climb up. Rise.

1335
02:25:18,586 --> 02:25:20,488
You're one of us now.

1336
02:25:20,588 --> 02:25:22,423
A life for a life.

1337
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:24,558
Come with us to  Sietch  Tabr.

1338
02:25:24,625 --> 02:25:25,659
No.

1339
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,294
Paul needs to get off-world.

1340
02:25:27,394 --> 02:25:29,463
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1341
02:25:29,563 --> 02:25:30,798
you have ships.

1342
02:25:30,898 --> 02:25:33,000
No.
- You have...

1343
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:35,169
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1344
02:25:36,604 --> 02:25:38,339
And my father came,

1345
02:25:39,273 --> 02:25:41,575
not for spice,

1346
02:25:41,642 --> 02:25:43,944
not for the riches,

1347
02:25:44,011 --> 02:25:46,147
but for the strength
of your people.

1348
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:51,252
My road leads into the desert.

1349
02:25:53,921 --> 02:25:55,289
I can see it.

1350
02:25:57,792 --> 02:25:59,426
If you'll have us,

1351
02:26:00,327 --> 02:26:01,929
we will come.

1352
02:26:50,544 --> 02:26:52,046
Desert power.

1353
02:26:53,347 --> 02:26:55,049
This is only the beginning.
